# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest

## Introduction

In this project, we analyse publiciy available data to understand the loan lending process and work out the best approach for a financial institution, which accurately identifies whom to lend loan to and help banks identify the loan defaulters for much-reduced credit risk. 

Classifiers that we used to build the model are Random Forest and Decision Trees. Theyâ€™ll be used separately to analyse the dataset and identify the patterns in the dataset and learn from those. 

Based on that analysis, predict whether a new applicant is likely to default on a loan or not.

Based on the results, interpretations or insights were made about the dataset.

The code is based on my own exploration of Python's functionalities and libraries.
